# A Complex Network Analysis of Wikipedia

A research project on Wikipedia article's structure and properties. For that, we model wikipedia as a graph, such that every articles is a node and every hyperlink between pages is an edge. We are initially interested in statistical properties properties such as degree distribution, average connectivity, transitivity, assortativity. In a second moment we are looking at preferential attachment and growth, relationshipis between fields of knowledge and clusters in the graph, among others aspects.

This project is based on the following papers:

    - Preferential attachment in the growth of social networks: The internet encyclopedia Wikipedia (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.036116)
    
    - Emergence of Scaling in Random Networks (DOI: 10.1126/science.286.5439.509 )

    - The diameter of the world wide web (DOI: 10.1038/43601)
